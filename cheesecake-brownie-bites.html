  <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>3/4 cup baking cocoa</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tablespoon instant espresso powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li>For Cheesecake Filling:</li>
    <li>1/2 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 large egg yolk</li>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</p>
    <p>2. In a large bowl, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw5msH2mAkg"><strong>whisk</strong></a> together the eggs, baking cocoa, salt, baking powder, espresso mixed with water, and vanilla until <a href=" " onclick="myFunction()" title="Mix until you can't see any more dry ingredients (i.e. - everything in the batter becomes the same color-except of course things like nuts or chips). It's important to mix slowly and gently rather than quickly.

    <p>3. Stir in the sugar and melted butter until well combined, then stir in the flour. (A firm rubber spatula works best.) Set brownie batter aside.</p>
    <p>4. In a separate bowl, prepare the cheesecake filling by stirring together the cream cheese, sugar and egg yolk until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag or plastic bag.</p>
    <p>5. Grease a non-stick mini-muffin pan with cooking spray or butter and then spoon a tablespoon of brownie batter into the greased cups. Pipe a generous amount of cheesecake filling atop the brownie batter, and then top off each cup with an additional teaspoon of brownie batter.</p>
    <p>6. Bake for about 12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</p>
    <p>7. Let brownie cool for about 10 minutes.</p>
