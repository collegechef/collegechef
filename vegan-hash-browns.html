  <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1 large potato</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
    <li>Seasoning salt to taste</li>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>1. Peel the potatoes, if desired. Use a large-holed cheese grater or food processor to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVo5u7Rj9u0"><strong>shred the potatoes</strong></a>. Place the potatoes in a <div class="tooltip">colander<span class="tooltiptext">a metal or plastic container with a perforated bottom, for draining and straining foods <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/colander">Source</a></span></div> and rinse well, or until the water runs clear. Let the potatoes drain.</p>
    <p>2. Squeeze the potatoes of their excess water by pressing against the side of the <div class="tooltip">colander<span class="tooltiptext">a metal or plastic container with a perforated bottom, for draining and straining foods <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/colander">Source</a></span></div> or squeezing in your fist. Or, place the potatoes in a clean, lint-free dish towel, roll them up, then press to remove excess moisture.</p>
    <p>3. Heat a large cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon of cooking oil and spread the oi, l over the surface. Add about 1/3 of the shredded potatoes. Let the potatoes fry, until deeply golden brown on the bottom (3-5 minutes). Season lightly with seasoning salt.</p>
    <p>4. Flip the potatoes and drizzle additional oil if needed. Let the potatoes cook on the second side without disturbing until golden brown and crispy again. Season lightly.</p>
    <p>5. Cook until the ratio of brown and white is to your liking.</li>
