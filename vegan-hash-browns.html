  <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1 large russet potato</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
    <li>Seasoning salt to taste</li>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <li>1. Peel the potatoes, if desired. Use a large-holed cheese grater or food processor to shred the potatoes. Place the potatoes in a colander and rinse well, or until the water runs clear. Let the potatoes drain.</li>
    <li>2. Squeeze the potatoes of their excess water by pressing against the side of the colander or squeezing in your fist. Or, place the potatoes in a clean, lint-free dish towel, roll them up, then press to remove excess moisture.</li>
    <li>3. Heat a large cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon of cooking oil and spread the oi, l over the surface. Add about 1/3 of the shredded potatoes. Let the potatoes fry, until deeply golden brown on the bottom (3-5 minutes). Season lightly with seasoning salt.</li>
    <li>4. Flip the potatoes and drizzle additional oil if needed. Let the potatoes cook on the second side without disturbing until golden brown and crispy again. Season lightly.</li>
    <li>5. Cook until the ratio of brown and white is to your liking.</li>
